## Testing 


## Functionality testing

I used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## Compatibility testing

Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in both Mozilla web developer tolls and Chrome developer tools.

I tested on hardware devices such as: 14' screen HP laptop, 17' screen Asus laptop, 27' hp monitor, Samsung s20fe, Samsung s7edge and Samsung Note 10.
